# Hive MOT003

| Model | MOT003  |
| Vendor  | Hive  |
| Description | Motion & Temperature sensor |
| Supports | occupancy, temperature, battery |

## Notes

### Pairing

If you purchased your sensor before November 2016:

1. Slide off the back cover of the larger sensor piece
2. Remove the battery
3. Locate the small white button
4. Put the battery back in place
5. Press the white button 10 times (once per second)
6. Now, turn the device over. You should be able to see on the front that the green light is on for five seconds, and then starts double flashing.

Once you see the light double flashing, you’re done!

If you purchased your sensor after November 2016:

1. Slide the front of the case up
2. Locate the small red button and hold down for approximately 10 seconds. During this time you will see a red light come on and go back off again.
3. A green light will then flash once.
4. After about 5 seconds, you will see a flashing amber light to indicate the sensor is in pairing mode.
 
Once the light stops flashing, you’re done!

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
